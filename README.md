# secure-payment-plugin

This project involves creating a secure third-party payment plugin for WooCommerce. The plugin allows users to send their shopping cart to a third-party payment processor without sharing the delivery address. It includes functionalities such as CSRF protection using a nonce field, secure data encryption and decryption for storing delivery addresses, and secure API communication with the third-party processor. Key features include:

- Addition of custom nonce field to checkout form for CSRF protection
- Processing of third-party payments with error handling and user notifications
- Secure transmission of cart details to the third-party payment processor
- Encryption of delivery addresses before storing in the database
- Comprehensive error logging and user notification system

Technologies and tools used: PHP, WooCommerce hooks and filters, OpenSSL for encryption, WordPress functions for HTTP requests and nonce verification.
